# Ecommerce Reviews API

A RESTful API that manages reviews data provided by consumers for an existing frontend reviews component of an e-commerce website.

## Features

- Diagnosed node.js bottleneck with New Relic after MySQL indexing â€“ used an NGINX cache and load balancer to horizontally scale five EC2 instances that - increased RPS from 750 to 2500 w/ 0.27% err rate (K6) and client load from 800 to 8000 w/ <1.2s latency (Loader.io).
- Conducted extract, transform and load using MySQL on millions of entries from CSV documents to preserve inherited legacy data.
- Engineered a testing framework using Mocha and Chai to achieve over 82% code coverage to ensure seamless API integration.
